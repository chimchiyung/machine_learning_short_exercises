These are short notebooks for various machine learning exercises.

timeseries_lstm_dropout.ipynb: This is a notebook of using LSTM instead of 1D CNN to classify FordA dataset timeseries modified from a Keras tutorial.

runDetectronBreastUltrasound.ipynb: This is an application of Detectron2 over breast ultrasound images for tumor detection.

CNN-RNN-VideoClassfication.ipynb: This is a CNN-RNN experiment over 10 classes from UCF video dataset, using PyTorch.

CNN-Transformer-VideoClassfication.ipynb: This is a video classification experiment over 10 classes from UCF video dataset, using PyTorch. Video frames are encoded by a pretrained EfficientNet-B3 CNN, and then fed into a Transformer encoder for classification.

AbaloneRingRegression.ipynb: This is a regression exercise over the abalone ring numbers of a datasets given various length and weight features.

VisualAutogressiveModeling.pdf: This is a short-presentation on reading paper about VAR Modeling for a private journal club.

byu_flagella_motor.ipynb: This is a notebook of solving the "BYU Flagella motor" in Kaggle using Faster RCNN in Torchvision.
